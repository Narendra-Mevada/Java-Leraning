When the calss want to take properties of another class then this process called <b>Inheritance</b>.<br>
There are 4 types of inheritances in java:
<h3><b>1. Single Level:</b></h3><br>
<div align="center">Base Class<br>|<br>|<br>|<br>Derrived Class</div><br>
We have a Parent Class or Base Class and Child, Sub or Derrived class.<br>Child class includes all properties of Parent child.
<br>ex:
<br>In following code you can see i made a class named "shape" and another class named "triangle" .<br> We use a keyword <b><u>extends</u></b> to connect Child class to Parent Class.

<h3><b>2. Multi Level:</b></h3><br>
<div align="center">Base Class<br>|<br>|<br>|<br>Derrived Class<br>|<br>|<br>|<br>Derrived Class of Derrived Class</div><br>
We can easily understand through following code:<br>
where another class created name "EqualiteralTriangle" and it extends to "Triangle" class.<br><br>

<h3><b>3. Hierarchial Inheritance:</b></h3><br>
<img src="/oops/Inheritance/Images/image.png" alt="image"><br>In this there are too many derrived classes and single Base class.<br>In following code you can see i added a another class "Circle" and that extends to the base class "Shape".<br> so, in following code we have three different class ,first one is base class and other are derrrived class this all derived class extends to a same class, this called "Heirarchial Inheritance".<br><br><img src="/oops/Inheritance/Images/hierarchial.png" alt="image"><br><br>
