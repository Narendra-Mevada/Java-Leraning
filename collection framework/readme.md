<h1>Collection Framework in Java</h1>

The **Collection Framework** in Java is a system that makes it easy to work with groups of objects (collections). It helps store, manage, and process data efficiently.

## Key Components

### **1. Interfaces**
Define rules for different types of collections:

- **List**: Stores elements in order (e.g., `ArrayList`).
- **Set**: Stores unique elements (e.g., `HashSet`).
- **Queue**: Stores elements in a queue (e.g., `PriorityQueue`).
- **Map**: Stores key-value pairs (e.g., `HashMap`).

### **2. Classes**
Provide ready-made solutions for these interfaces:

- **ArrayList**: Dynamic array.
- **HashSet**: Unique elements without order.
- **HashMap**: Key-value storage.

### **3. Methods**
Ready-to-use functions to:

- Add elements.
- Remove elements.
- Search, sort, or iterate through collections.

## Why Use It?

- Saves time by providing pre-built tools.
- Makes code easier to write and read.
- Handles data efficiently.
